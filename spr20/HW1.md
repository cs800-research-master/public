# Homework 1: Responsible Conduct of Research

**Due:** Tuesday, January 21, 2020 *before* class 

## Assignment 

All graduate students must complete the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training before completing 12 credit hours of graduate work. Your assignment is to read the information at https://www.odu.edu/impact/responsible-conduct-of-training and follow the instructions to complete your RCR training.  Note that the “Responsible Conduct of Research for Engineers” option is the most applicable for CS.

Once you have completed all the required modules, you will be able to print out and/or take a screenshot of a completion certificate on the “CITI RCR Course Completion Page”.

If you have previously completed the RCR training at ODU, you should have an indication of this in [Degree Works](https://degree.odu.edu).
