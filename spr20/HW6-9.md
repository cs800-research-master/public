# ODU Research Summaries

This covers 3 separate assignments to write summaries of ODU-CS research.  

* HW 6 - due Thursday, March 5, 2020 - [Dr. Wu](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~jwu/)'s or [Dr. Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/)'s paper
* HW 7 - due Thursday, March 24, 2020 - [Dr. Chernikov](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~achernik/)'s paper
* HW 8 - due Thursday, April 2, 2020 - [Dr. Jain](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~jain/)'s or [Dr. Olariu](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~olariu/)'s paper

## Assignment

Write a summary of the given paper.  Similar to HW3, your summary, written in your own words, must answer at least the following questions:

* What are the motivations for the work?
* What problem are the authors addressing?
* What is the proposed solution?
* What is the evaluation of the work?
* What are the contributions?
* What are the future directions for this research?

In addition to the summary, there are two other components:
* You must list at least 3 questions or comments that you have about the paper. 
* You must find all of the references in the paper online. **(UPDATE: Do this for only the first 20 references.)** For each reference, provide the URL where the reference can be accessed.  Use the reference tag (e.g., [2]) to indicate the reference and put them in the same order as in the original reference list. If you are unable to find an online version of a particular reference, describe how you tried to find it. ***This should go in a separate Markdown file named HWx-refs.md, where x is the assignment number.*** Make sure that the URLs are displayed in the Markdown (i.e., don't create anchor text that hides the URLs).

Use the [template from HW3](https://www.overleaf.com/read/btrdddtcqfyb) with the following changes:
* add the BibTeX entry for the paper you are summarizing to your BibTeX file
* use the `\cite{}` command after the paper title at the top of your summary
  * Ex: `{\large\textbf{Summary of ``Social Cards Probably Provide For Better Understanding Of Web Archive Collections" \cite{jones-cikm19}}}`
* remove the `\nocite{*}` line so that only this paper's reference line is displayed
* remove the `\renewcommand\refname{\large{Potentially Interesting References}}` line

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to the repository on GitHub.  All of your summaries for these assignments should go in the same repo. 

Name your files according to the assignment (`HW6`, `HW7`, `HW8`).  For instance, for Dr. Chernikov's paper, the filenames should be `HW7-summary.tex`, `HW7-summary.pdf`, and `HW7-refs.md`.  You may use a single BibTeX file for all of the assignments.

We will *not* use Blackboard for the submission of these assignments.  When you are ready to submit, make your final commit and use the commit message: `Ready to grade @weiglemc`. This will generate an email to me.

I will provide feedback by adding a file (most likely named `feedback.md`) to your assignment GitHub repo. I will tag you so that you receive an email whenever I update this file (feedback for all of the assignments will go in the same file).
