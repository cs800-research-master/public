# Homework 3: Research Paper Summary
*This is the public posting of the assignment. See Piazza for the invite link to make your submission in your own repository in the class organization*

**Due:** Tuesday, February 4, 2020 *before* class

## Assignment

Read a paper in your research area (get a suggestion from your advisor) and write a summary.  You must use LaTeX to complete this assignment.  A template is available at https://www.overleaf.com/read/btrdddtcqfyb (make sure you change the page headings appropriately).

Your summary, *written in your own words*, must answer at least the following questions: 
* What are the motivations for the work?
* What problem are the authors addressing? 
* What is the proposed solution?
* What is the evaluation of the work?
* What are the contributions?
* What are the future directions for this research?

In addition, you must list at least 3 questions or comments that you have about the paper.  Use the LaTeX `enumerate` environment for this list.

You must also create a list of potentially interesting papers to read from the paper's References section.  Format these in BiBTeX and include the list with `\nocite{*}` (see the template for an example).

Your summary, questions, and references together should be no longer than 2 pages.

In a couple weeks, you will exchange papers and provide editing comments for another classmate.
