# Homework 5: Revision of Research Paper Summary

**Due:** Tuesday, February 25, 2020 *before* class

## Assignment

Take the comments from your classmate and revise your research paper summary from HW3.  

## Submission

You will submit this assignment in your hw3-summary repo (*this is not a typo, add your update to your HW3 repo*).  

To help me see what changes you've made, keep the name of your BibTeX and LaTeX files the same as you had for HW3 (e.g., `HW3-summary.tex`). GitHub will highlight the changes between the revisions.

But, give the final PDF a different name, like `HW5-revised-summary.pdf`.

Submit the URL of your revised summary in Blackboard:

* Click on HW5 under Homeworks
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your *revised summary* into the edit box
  * should be something like ht<span>tps://</span>github.com/cs800-research-spr20/hw3-summary-*username*/HW5-revised-summary.pdf
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
