# Homework 2: Establish an Academic Presence

**Due:** Tuesday, January 28, 2020 *before* class

To demonstrate that you have completed these tasks, you will create a Markdown report named `HW2-report.md`.  All reports must include your name, class, assignment number/title, and date.  

***Do not edit this file, `README.md`***

# Assignment

Acknowledgement: Parts of this assignment were inspired by [CS 395 at ODU](https://github.com/phonedude/cs395-s20/blob/master/assignments/assignment-01.md) and [CS 5014 at Virginia Tech](http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs5014/F15/Assign14.html).

### Part 1 - Online Research Presence

***Report:*** You will be creating multiple online accounts and webpages.  Include links to all of these accounts and/or pages in your Markdown report.  For your academic webpage, also include links to any webpages you used as inspiration.

For all of the accounts you create, fill out your bio and include an appropriate profile picture. If you already have an account made and are fine with it being your professional account, you do not need to create an additional one. Remember that all of these accounts are expressions of your professional online presence, so you should be comfortable sharing with a potential employer.

There should be some linkage from each of these accounts to the others.  For example, if someone finds your Twitter account, they should be able to discover all of these other accounts. Often this can be done by linking to these accounts from your academic webpage and then including the URI of your webpage in the bio of the other accounts.

**Twitter.**
Create a Twitter account. This account will be a "professional" identity, so feel free to create a new account if you want to partition your professional identity from an already existing recreational identity.

**Google Scholar.** 
Create an account on Google Scholar.  

**ORCID.**
Create an ORCID.

**Slideshare.** 
Create a SlideShare account.

**LinkedIn.**
Create a LinkedIn account.

**Academic Webpage.** 
Create an academic webpage. You should include elements that we have discussed in class, including your email address and links to the other accounts you have created above. The goal of this webpage is to show off your role within the CS Department and the profession. There should be some effort to include (reasonable) use of color and visual elements. That is, your webpage should be visually appealing and professional. You may host this webpage wherever you wish, but ht<span>tps://</span>cs.odu.edu/~*CSusername*/ should redirect to that webpage so that your page can easily be discovered. 

### Part 2 - Find Researchers Online

**Twitter.** Start following academic accounts.  Begin by following your class colleagues (post your Twitter handle in Piazza as a note with the `hw2` label), @oducs, ODU CS faculty and labs (@weiglemc, @phonedude_mln, @openmaze, @fanchyna, @VikasGAshok1, @haoscs, @jain_ODU, @WebSciDL, @NirdsLab), and @AcademicsSay. Consider using "lists" to partition accounts thematically.  Investigate others' following lists for recommendations on others to follow.   Find additional researchers in your research area to follow. You should be *following at least 40 accounts* before the assignment deadline. 

**Google Scholar.** Start by following ODU CS faculty ([faculty list](https://odu.edu/compsci/directory)). Identify and follow additional scholars in your research area.

***Report:*** For those researchers in your area who are outside of ODU, include their name and links to their academic webpage, Twitter, and Google Scholar (as available). You should identify at least 5 of these persons before the assignment deadline. I expect you to continue identifying and following researchers outside of ODU throughout the semester (and your academic career).

### Part 3 - \#cs800s20 \#TIL 

Using your Twitter account, before each Tuesday class retweet an interesting research or academic tool, data set, analysis, research result, commentary, etc. that you may discuss with the class for 2-3 minutes. (I will choose a few students each week.) When you "quote tweet", add a short, constructive commentary along with the hashtags "[\#cs800s20 \#TIL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cs800s20%20%23TIL&f=live)" 

We will repeat the "\#cs800s20 \#TIL" excercise at the start of every Tuesday class.  The purpose is to engage you with current events.

***Report:*** There is nothing to include in your report for this section, but be prepared to talk about your "\#TIL" in class each Tuesday.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to the shared repository on GitHub.  Your repo should include at least `README.md` (this file) and `HW2-report.md`.
