# Homework 4: Publication Venues and BibTeX
 
**Due:** Tuesday, February 23, 2021 *before* class

## Assignment

Write a report (LaTeX and PDF required) that answers the following questions.

**Q1.**  Determine the key publication venues (conferences/journals) in your area of research and describe how you did this.  For the top 3 venues, list the following:
* URL of the upcoming (or most recent) conference or journal website
* submission categories (types of submissions)
* review process (single-blind vs. double-blind, revisions allowed, etc.)
* submission deadlines
* typical time between submission and notification of acceptance 

*Note:* If you are not sure about the key venues in your research area, talk with your advisor and senior students about appropriate publication venues.  Where have your advisor and colleagues published and submitted papers?  Where do they want to publish?

**Q2.** Describe how you would go about determining if a conference or journal was legitimate or predatory. For those you would determine to be legitimate, describe how you would estimate their quality.

**Q3.** Using BibTeX and LaTeX, replicate the References section of the paper that you read and summarized in HW3 (up to a max of 15 papers).  Determine what BibTeX style the authors used (there are standard class files for IEEE and ACM) and use that for formatting.  Discuss any manual edits you made for BibTeX entries that you found online.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to the repository on GitHub.  Your repo should include at least the following files:
* `README.md` (this file)
* `HW4-report.tex`
* `HW4-report.pdf`
* the BiBTeX file (ending in `.bib`) used for Q3
* the BiBTeX class file (usually ending in `.bst`) used for Q3
* the PDF of the paper from HW2

Submit the URL of your repo in Blackboard:

* Click on HW4 under Homeworks
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your report into the edit box
  * should be something like ht<span>tps://</span>github.com/cs800-research-spr21/hw4-pubs-*username*/HW4-report.pdf
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
