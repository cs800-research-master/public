# Homework 3: Research Paper Summary 

**Due:** Tuesday, February 16, 2021 *before* class

## Assignment

Read a paper in your research area and write a summary.  You must use LaTeX to complete this assignment.  I've created a [paper summary template in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/btrdddtcqfyb) (make sure you change the page headings appropriately).

Talk to your advisor to get a suggestion for a paper to read.

Your summary, *written in your own words*, must answer at least the following questions: 
* What are the motivations for the work?
* What problem are the authors addressing? 
* What is the proposed solution?
* What is the evaluation of the work?
* What are the contributions?
* What are the future directions for this research?

In addition, you must list at least 3 questions or comments that you have about the paper.  Use the LaTeX `enumerate` environment for this list.

You must also create a list of potentially interesting papers to read from the paper's References section.  Format these in BiBTeX and include the list with `\nocite{*}` (see the template for an example).

Your summary, questions, and references together should be no longer than 2 pages.

The goal is that someone not in your research area (like me) should be able to read this summary and understand the basic idea of the paper. This summary should reflect your understanding of the paper.  *Do not copy/paste or just paraphrase sections directly from the paper.*

There are several [paper summary examples on the WS-DL blog](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/search/label/paper%20summary).  These are likely longer than what you should do for this assignment, but can serve as an idea of what a paper summary should look and sound like.

I will provide feedback on this and you'll do a round of revisions in a later HW assignment.

## Submission

Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to the repository on GitHub.  Your repo should include at least the following files:
* `README.md` (this file)
* `summary-lastname.tex` - *replace `lastname` with your last name*
* `summary-lastname.pdf`
* a BiBTeX file (ending in `.bib`)
* a PDF of the paper that you're summarizing

Submit the URL of your repo in Blackboard:

* Click on HW3 under Assignments
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your repo into the edit box
  * should be something like ht<span>tps://</span>github.com/cs800-research-spr21/hw3-summary-*username*/
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.

I will provide feedback on your .tex file in the GitHub repo using the "Feedback" pull request.
