# Personal Introductions

**Due:** Tuesday, January 19, 2021 by 1:30pm

## Assignment

We will be using Piazza this semester for class communication.  This is a hybrid in-person/online class (and everyone is starting the semester online), so it is important that we all get accustomed to using our online tools to communicate and get to know each other.  This assignment is to help us get started on both of these tasks.  We will use our Piazza group to provide personal introductions to each other.

In your introduction, provide at least the following information:
* Name (include pronunciation help if people often mispronounce your name)
* PhD advisor/research group
* Hometown/home country
* Are you a full-time or part-time student?  Do you work full-time?
* Do you plan to attend class during our class meeting time, or will you watch recordings later?  (Note: I highly recommend that you attend during class time either in-person or via Zoom unless you are absolutely unable to.)
* Why you are taking this course and what do you expect to gain from it?
* What are your research or computing/technology interests?
* Share one or two interesting things about yourself so that your classmates can get to know you better.

I encourage you to provide additional information if you wish.  You do not have to follow the bulleted list format.

We will look at all of the entries in class on Tuesday.  I encourage you to post early, read your classmates' entries, and reply to your classmates if you have something in common.

## Procedure

Login to our Piazza site (link in Blackboard) and set up your account (click the Gear and then Account/Email Settings), including a picture.  This will only be visible to students in our class.

Create a new Note post (*not reply*) in the `personal-intro` folder to provide your introduction.  Put your name as the "Summary" line. I've already added my introduction as an example for you. 

We will be using Markdown a good bit this semester, so I encourage you to format your introduction using this markup style for practice. Click the "Markdown editor" radio button in the Details section of the Piazza Note editor.
