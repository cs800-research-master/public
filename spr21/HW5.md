# Homework 5: Revision of Research Paper Summary

**Due:** Thursday, March 11, 2021 by 11:59pm 
 
## Assignment

Take the feedback I've provided on HW3 and revise your research paper summary.   

In Overleaf, make a copy of your HW3 project and apply your revisions in the new HW5 project.

Create a new Markdown file (in your hw3-summary repo) named CHANGES.md with a list/description of the changes you made.  Typos and minor edits can be grouped together in a single general entry, but if you make more substantive changes, describe what you did.

## Submission

You will submit the .tex and .bib files for this assignment along with CHANGES.md in your hw3-summary repo (*this is not a typo, add your update to your HW3 repo*).  

To help me see what changes you've made, keep the name of your BibTeX and LaTeX files the same as you had for HW3 (e.g., `HW3-summary.tex`). GitHub will highlight the changes between the revisions.

Submit the URLs of both your HW3 and HW5 Overleaf projects in Blackboard:

* Click on HW5 under Assignments
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URLs of your Overleaf projects into the edit box
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
